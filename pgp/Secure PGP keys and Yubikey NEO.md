Secure PGP keys and YubiKey NEO
===============================

**Objective:** Create a secure OpenPGP keypair, eg: offline master key with subkeys (aka "laptop keys") stored on a YubiKey NEO hardware device for everyday use.

Below is a collection of notes and info that helped me navigate through a jungle of new concepts, jargon, bad UI decisions, broken software, bugs and other obstacles to reach the above goal. â€“ [Jonathan](https://jonathancross.com)

## About the YubiKey NEO
<img align="right" src="../images/yubikey-neo-n.jpg" alt="yubikey neo-n"> This is an elegant device with many functions including the ability to store OpenPGP keys and use them to sign, encrypt and / or authenticate.  The keys cannot be extracted from the device.  The OpenPGP java apps that do the signing are Open Source.  **NOTE:** Yubico has released the "upgraded" **YubiKey 4** -- [which I discovered is not open source](https://github.com/Yubico/ykneo-openpgp/issues/2#issuecomment-218436213) and is phasing out the NEO-n.  The maximum RSA key size for the YubiKey NEO 3 was 2048 bits, which is fine for subkeys.  You can of course create a 4096 bit master key which stays offline.  Newer YubiKey 4+ support 4096 bit keys.  The YubiKey 5 now supports Curve25519 which is recommended for security and speed.

Please note that YubiKey NEO devices issued before 2015-04-14 [contain an insecure OpenPGP applet](https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/SecurityAdvisory%202015-04-14.html).
